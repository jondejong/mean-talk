# Getting MEAN
## Introduction to the MEAN stack

### Code and slides from my introduction to the MEAN stack talk on 3/27/2014

This project depends on NPM and GruntJS.

To run the slides:

    cd slides
    npm install
    bower install
    grunt serve

There are two steps to run the final app. To launch the webservices:

    cd code/hello-universe-things
    npm install
    npm start

To run the UI:

    cd code/ui
    npm install
    bower install
    grunt serve
